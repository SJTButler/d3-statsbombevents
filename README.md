# D3-Statsbombevents 

## About this Project

This is a library to provide a simple method to plot statsbomb events-level data using [d3.js](http://d3js.org). It is intended to be highly customizable to allow users to plot the data in ways that suit the user's needs.

## Code Examples

## Statsbomb Open Data

This library is designed for use with the data provided by [Statsbomb](http://statsbomb.com). For research and non-commercial purposes, Statsbomb provides a subset of their data free of charge at [statsbomb/open-data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data), which I have used here to provide examples of how to use this library. Use of this data requires the user to abide by the [Statsbomb User Agreement](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data/blob/master/LICENSE.pdf) and to properly credit its use.

Note: This library, and its author, are not affiliated in any way with Statsbomb, and as such, Statsbomb are not responsible for any issues resulting from use of this library.
